Thou have defeted me.
I am now under your command!

But let me tell you, why I did what I did…

For millenias, humans have been a plague to this magnificent
masterpiece of space material. In fact, this Earth is the
only one in the entire galaxy that’s able harbour
my beautiful sea-hourses. 
But the humans, they have no respect.
I mean, look how easily they just left.

You really want to be on their side?
