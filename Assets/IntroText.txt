Yo, listen up, heres a story, about a blue planet, when we
lived in a blue time

and everyting was blue, and we had food... and a life
damm... I need a life...

Either way, as you should know by now you've been selected
for a very special mission!

But first... history lesson...

Many years ago, we lived on Planet Earth.
Stupid Americans decided to vote in Donald Trump as president. 
Holy f*** was that a mistake...

It's been many years since a god was THIS pissed off...

No dought you've heard the story about Atlantis, the sunken city?

Well, in short, thriving city, randomly sunk.

In reality, they had just pissed off Poseidon...
See where this is going?

Well, Donald Trump decided that climate change was just "words in the wind".
After 3  years in office, he had rolled back all improvements and coal plants where up and running.

Guess who that pissed off? Yeah? 
Great, now you're caught up,
off you go!
