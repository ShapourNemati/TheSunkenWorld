Yo, listen up, heres a story
about a blue planet, when we
lived in a blue time

and everyting was blue, 
and we had food
and a life
damm... I need a life...

Either way, as you should know by now
you've been selected for a very special 
mission, but first... history lesson...

Many years ago, we lived on Planet Earth.
Stupid Americans decided to vote in
Donal Trump as president. Holy f*** was
that a mistake...

It's been many years since a god was THIS
pissed off...

No dought you've heard the story about Atlantis,
the sunken city?

Well, in short, thriving city, randomly sunk.

In reality, they had just pissed off Possidon...
See there this is going?

Well, Donald Trump decided that climate chance
was just "words in the wind". After 3  years
in office, he had rolled back all improvements
and coal plans where up and running.

Guess who that pissed off? Yeah?
Great, now you're caught up,
off you go!
