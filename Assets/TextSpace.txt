So, now that you’re on the way and can’t return
I’ll talk about your mission.

We’re dumping you into Atlantis, to fight Poseidon.

If you succeed, there’s a chance the oceans will retrieve,
and humans can return and repopulate Earth,
else, well, you die, I guess…

Try and avoid the mermaids, sharks and fish. Shoot to kill.
[WASDA Controls, J to dash, K to kill]
Destroy Poseidon’s Gems to weaken his power.

Good Luck!
